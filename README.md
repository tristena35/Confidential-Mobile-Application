## Bug/Issues:

- When a chat is sent through Confidential Chat a second time, the timer starts to run before the receiving user opens the message.
- The likes and dislikes system has flaws in it on the Feed Page.
- When one user sends a friend request to another user while they are both on their accounts, it will end up crashing both of their apps.
- On the main page, under the Chat tab, the latest messages are sometimes out of order and show for the wrong user.
- The Settings Page is only about 15% done, I still need to add many features.
- On the Chat Page, the more options button allows the user to delete the conversation but it only deletes the the messages and not the conversation itself.
- Cloud Notifications using Node.Js have not been fully implemented. Most of the code has been done for it, but still some errors one the Firebase side.
